# Matplotlib axes_grid Toolkit

Note: AxesGrid toolkit has been a part of matplotlib since v 0.99. Originally, the toolkit had a single namespace of axes_grid. In more recent version, the toolkit has divided into two separate namespace (``axes_grid1 and axisartist``). While axes_grid namespace is maintained for the backward compatibility, use of axes_grid1 and axisartist is recommended. For the documentation on axes_grid, see [the previous version of the docs](https://matplotlib.org/2.0.1/mpl_toolkits/axes_grid/index.html#toolkit-axesgrid-index).
