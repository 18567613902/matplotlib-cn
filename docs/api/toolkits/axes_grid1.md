# Matplotlib axes_grid1 Toolkit

The matplotlib ``mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1`` toolkit is a collection of helper classes to ease displaying multiple images in matplotlib. While the aspect parameter in matplotlib adjust the position of the single axes, axes_grid1 toolkit provides a framework to adjust the position of multiple axes according to their aspects.

See [What is axes_grid1 toolkit?](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/toolkits/axes_grid.html#axes-grid1-users-guide-index) for a guide on the usage of axes_grid1.
